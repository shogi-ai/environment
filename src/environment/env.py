    Shogi environment for reinforcement learning.

    This environment simulates a game of Shogi, a Japanese variant of chess.
    It provides an action space representing all possible moves and an observation space representing the Shogi board.
    The game continues until a player wins, the game reaches a stalemate, or a specified number of moves is reached.

    Attributes:
        board: Shogi board object.
        action_space: MultiDiscrete space representing all possible moves.
        observation_space: MultiDiscrete space representing the Shogi board.
        move: Number of moves made in the game.

    Methods:
        __init__: Initialize the Shogi environment.
        reset: Reset the environment to its initial state.
        sample_action: Sample a random legal move.
        step: Take a step in the environment based on the action.
        get_observation: Get the current observation of the Shogi board.
        render: Render the current state of the Shogi board.
        mask_and_valid_moves: Get the mask and valid moves for the current player.
